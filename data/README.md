### Fin_interaction_0dpa_vs_2dpa.xlsx

A spreadsheet of the tailfin RNA-seq analysis that identified the 274 differentially expressed genes shown in Figure 3E of the Hartig 2016 paper. The differentially expressed genes are highlighted, green for genes downregulated in cort-treated fish, red for upregulated genes.
