# Data

Preliminary data storage

### Hartig_Fine_Data_raw

Excel spreadsheets of the tailfin RNA-seq analysis that identified differentially expressed genes  of the Hartig 2016 paper. The differentially expressed genes are highlighted, green for genes downregulated in cort-treated fish, red for upregulated genes.

### Hou_Data_raw

`aba2084_tables_s1_to_s7.xlsx` : Excel spreadsheet of supplemental tables S1 through S7 from Hou 2020. 

`GSE137971_cells.csv` : assignment of cell identifiers to clusters

`GSM4095[393-400]_[samp1,samp2,1dpa,2dpa,4dpa]_DGEmatrix.csv.gz` : expression matrices from Hou data, pulled from NCBI GEO database supplementary file. 

`SupplementaryTableS2.xlsx` : Excel spreadsheet of full supplementary table 2.

### Hartig_gene_list.csv

`Hartig_gene_list.csv` : Initial gene list of differentially expressed genes. Add factor column titled `DiffExp` with values [`upregulated`, `downregulated`, `none`] to reflect the highlighting in `Fin_interaction_0dpa_vs_2dpa.xlsx`.

`Hartig_[0,2,4]dpa_ctrl_vs_treated` : gene lists of differentially expressed genes from Hartig 2016 paper for each dpa. 

`Hartig_0dpa_vs_2dpa_[ctrl,treated].csv` : gene list of differentially expressed genes for the interaction between 0 and 2 dpa. 

### Hou_gene_list.csv

`Hou_gene_list.csv` : Supplementary Table S2 Genes differentially enriched in major cell types **(top 50)**. 

`Hou_gene_list_full.csv` : **Full** Supplementary Table S2
